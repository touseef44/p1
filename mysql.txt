DELETE Command:
The DELETE command is used to remove specific rows from a table based on a condition.
It allows you to specify a condition using the WHERE clause to filter the rows to be deleted.

TRUNCATE:
removes all rows from the table, and it cannot be used with a WHERE clause.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY KEY:
    A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE
    There can be only one PRIMARY KEY constraint in a table.
    Used as a Foreign Key.
UNIQUE KEY:
    key columns can contain NULL values, but each non-NULL value must be unique.
    A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints.
    Not Used as a Foreign Key.

CASCADE:
    When a referenced row in the parent table is deleted, 
    the corresponding rows in the child table are also deleted.

SET NULL:
    When a referenced row in the parent table is deleted, 
    the corresponding foreign key values in the child table are set to NULL.

SET DEFAULT:
    Similar to SET NULL, but the foreign key values are set to their default values.

NO ACTION:
    This is the default behavior. It prevents the deletion of a referenced row in the parent table 
    if there are corresponding rows in the child table.

RESTRICT:
    Similar to NO ACTION. It prevents the deletion of a referenced row in the parent table 
    if there are corresponding rows in the child table.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indexes are most effective for columns used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HAVING is used in conjunction with GROUP BY, while WHERE is used independently of GROUP BY.
If there is no GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause is treated like a WHERE clause.
